THE NUMBER GUESSER

I was bored at work so I wrote these two scripts. First I wrote the guesser, then the solver.

NUMBER_GUESS
Number guess takes a max number and creates a random number between 0 and your number.
You may then guess and it will tell you once you are right an how many guesses it took.

NUMBER_SOLVER
This program solves the number guesser in the minimum number of moves to guarantee a hit.
It uses a binary search to do so (although it might be off by 1 actually I don't know).
